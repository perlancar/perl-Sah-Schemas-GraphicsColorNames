# ABSTRACT: Alias for Sah::Schemas::GraphicsColorNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I use "color schemes" to refer to modules in the L<Graphics::ColorNames>::*
namespace, while "color themes" to refer to modules in the L<ColorTheme>::*
namespace. The color theme modules allow defining color items that have
background color (in addition to foreground color), as well as dynamic color
(coderef).
